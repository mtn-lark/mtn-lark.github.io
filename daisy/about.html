  This is the about.html page for my site dedicated to showing off my cat :3
  It has my cat's backstory.
  It includes navigation to the other pages of this site.

  This website's design is based off of the design by my friend Isabella Zhu, a
  design student at USC.
  There are certain elements of her design that I don't know how to do yet that
  I plan on updating in future projects. She was provided with the wireframe
  diagram included, and given a brief of the vibe + content I want the website
  to have.

            I adopted Daisy in February 2023. I was looking to adopt a cat as an
            emotional support animal, and overheard that a friend of a friend
            was taking care of a street cat near campus and was looking for
            someone to adopt it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got her contact info and quickly started visiting the alley that
            Daisy lived in. Even as a street cat, he was beautiful and pretty
            friendly! However, he was very large and did NOT like to be picked
            up, so it took me visiting the alley 5 times with a carrier (and the
            help of my friend's mom) to finally take him to a vet and then home.
            At the vet, Daisy got vaccinations and a microchip. He was so sweet,
            they couldn't believe I had picked him up off the street!
          </p>

          <p>
            After the vet, I took Daisy home. Even though he was in a totally
            new environment, he was happy to explore and find new places to
            hide. At first, he just slept most of the time, occasionally coming
            out to find more places to explore and sit next to me. It was less
            than a month before he was sleeping with me at night, trying to sit
            on my laptop, and running around chasing toys.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, after many months or years on the street, Daisy was
            not in the best shape. Over the next year, Daisy had to endure a
            weight-loss diet before finally reaching a healthy weight of 13
            pounds. He had a broken tooth pulled so he wouldn't be in pain.
            Having never owned a cat before, I had a lot of learning to do, too.
            I had to learn how to give him medicine and clip his nails, two
            things he still doesn't like.

            Today, Daisy loves to lounge on our dorm couch and chase spring
            toys. He is as friendly and fluffy as the day I got him. He has
            learned to love sitting on laps and making biscuits, and to tolerate
            having his majestic coat brushed. He tries to eat any yarn I use to
            crochet. He has learned a grand total of 1 trick: standing on his
            back legs to get a treat! Daisy can still be pretty jumpy -- he
            hides when someone knocks on our door, and has to take anti-anxiety
            medicine for car rides to the vet. But overall, he is the perfect
            cat for me &#58;&#41;
