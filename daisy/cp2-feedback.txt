Please fill out the following and submit with your CP 2 submission
(added to help us know what to focus on when grading):

1. What have you learned and applied in CP 2 since CP 1?
    I learned how to select elements using Javascript, and to think systematically
    about connecting elements to functions.

2. To what extent would you like feedback in CP 2 (e.g. thorough, particular areas of HTML/CSS/JS/UI)?
    I would like feedback on my JSDoc documentation -- I haven't done it before.
    I also would appreciate feedback on the general structure of my UI, and if
    there are more efficient ways to implement the same/similar layout.

3. Anything else you would like the grader to know?
    IMPORTANT - These are the RELEVANT FILES:
    - dressup.html
    - dressup-styles.css
    - dressup.js
    The only other major change is that images have been added to imgs/dressup.
    Everything else is mostly the same from CP1 - the dressup page is the only
    one with Javascript integration.

    The github link definitely should work, but the website is also public here:
