  This is the index.html page for my site dedicated to showing of my cat :3
  It includes navigation to the other pages of this site.

  This website's design is based off of the design by my friend Isabella Zhu, a
  design student at USC.
  There are certain elements of her design that I don't know how to do yet that
  I plan on updating in future projects. She was provided with the wireframe
  diagram included, and given a brief of the vibe + content I want the website
  to have.
